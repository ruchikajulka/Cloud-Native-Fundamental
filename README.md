# Cloud-Native-Fundamental
## Lesson 1 Notes -
Cloud-native refers to the set of practices that empowers an organization to build and manage applications at scale. They can achieve this goal by using private, hybrid, or public cloud providers. In addition to scale, an organization needs to be agile in integrating customer feedback and adapting to the surrounding technology ecosystem.

Containers are closely associated with cloud-native terminology. Containers are used to run a single application with all required dependencies. The main characteristics of containers are easy to manage, deploy, and fast to recover. As such, often, a microservice-based architecture is chosen in tandem with cloud-native tooling. Microservices are used to manage and configure a collection of small, independent services that can be easily packaged and executed within a container.

Kubernetes had its first initial release in 2014 and it derives from Borg, a Google open-source container orchestrator. Currently, Kubernetes is part of CNCF or Cloud Native Computing Foundation. CNCF was founded in 2015, and it provides a vendor-neutral home to open-source projects such as Kubernetes, Prometheus, ETCD, Envoy, and many more.

From a business perspective, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:

Agility - perform strategic transformations
Growth - quickly iterate on customer feedback
Service availability - ensures the product is available to customers 24/7
From a technical perspective, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:

Automation - release a service without human intervention
Orchestration - introduce a container orchestrator to manage thousands of services with minimal effort
Observability - ability to independently troubleshoot and debug each component
